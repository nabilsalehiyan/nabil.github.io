Component Analysis is a method of data analysis that eliminates noise, finds
components (orthogonal to each other) that explain the variables, shows
similarity between variables (through angles), shows similarity between
observations (through distance), and compresses information to show only what
matters. The goal is to see which components are the main contributors to the
phenomenon’s we observe. For example, what aspect of cell phones (such as
camera megapixels) predict things such as the price range they fall in. </span></p>

describe our data. For simplicity I will look at the highest 2 dimensions. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>For
dimension 2, we see that the main contributions are made by px_width and
px_height. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>In a
bootstrap analysis I saw that some of the gray variables are also contributors
to these dimensions which shows that in the raw data- they did not contribute
due to chance. If this analysis was done with an infinite population and with
replacement, these other variables would could be trusted to replicate in
dimensions 1 and 2. The only two that did not contribute (in raw OR bootstrap) was
n_cores and mobile_wt. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>Here in
the variables loading as inertia graph we can confirm the variables that make
up the first two dimensions. Sc_w/sc_h &amp; pc/fc make up dimension 1 and
px_width/px_height make up dimension 2. We also see that n_cores and int_memory
is in the middle- they also did not show up as significant contributors in the bar
graphs. To investigate whether these variables are true averages or fall in
another dimension, we must look towards the circle of correlation. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>In this
circle of correlation, we see that n_cores and int_memory are still in the
center and nowhere near the edge of the circle which suggests that they lie in
a different dimension. Also, if we look at the variable loadings as correlation
data that was provided, we see that the highest loadings for int_memory is in
the fourth dimension and the highest for n_cores lies in the fifth dimension. <img
width=468 height=35 id="Picture 161"
src="multivariate%20analysis%20cookbook%20(1).fld/image006.png"></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>Furthermore,
we can infer some correlations between the variables by looking at the arrows.
We see that fc and sc_h are almost orthogonal to each other which should mean
they do not relate to one another. We also see that pc and sc_w are going in
almost opposite directions, which suggests they have a large negative
correlation. Lastly, we see some positive correlations between sc_w and sc_w,
fc and pc, as well as pc_width and px_height- because their arrows are going in
the same direction. We must keep in mind that because of the distance these
variables have from edge of the circle, we cannot reliably approximate their
correlation. To confirm these inferences, I looked at the correlation matrix
heat map. <img width=469 height=261 id="Picture 159"

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>The
heatmap confirms all the speculations I made. Pc &amp; fc have a positive
correlation of 62, px_height and px_width have a positive correlation of 48,
and sc_h and sc_w have a positive correlation of 48. We also see a negative
correlation of -19 between pc and sc_w and we see no correlation between fc and
screen height (0). </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>We can now
move onto the observation groups which were price ranges of high, med, low, and
vhigh.</span></p>

alt="Diagram&#10;&#10;Description automatically generated"></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>We see
here that there seems to be an inverse relationship between the colored dots. I
assumed that there was a negative correlation between low and high price, as
well as vhigh and medium price. Also, when we look at the variables projected
onto the observation groups, it seems like things such as fc and pc relate to
low price (interesting). Also, screen size falls in the vhigh price category,
and pixel resolution falls between high and medium prices. To investigate the
reliability of this graph we must look towards the tolerance intervals and
confidence interval graph.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>Here we
see an overlap between the tolerance intervals. This shows that we cannot
reliably assign our observations to groups. Meaning we can’t say for certain
that fc and pc predict low priced phones or that screen size predicts high
prices. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>Lastly, we
do not see an overlap between the confidence intervals. This suggests that the
averages of these groups do in fact differ. So, although we have low accuracy
in group assignment, we can reliably differ the average prices of these groups
from one another. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>Through
this data visualization we can infer that we cannot reliably assign cell phones
with the groups of price ranges for dimension 1 &amp; 2. Some features such as
screen size can be attributed to higher prices but in general, they vary too
much to say which variable predicts price. Lastly, group means are reliably
different for dimension 1 &amp; 2. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>Correspondence
analysis is a method of multivariate data analysis that analyzes categorical
data. This data is stored in a contingency table. CA transforms the data into
rows and columns and the factor scores for them respectively. These scores can
be visualized in the same map since they share the same variance. After this
has been done, we assign a mass to the rows and a weight to the columns. The
greater the mass, the higher the importance- and the same for the weights. It
is best to use CA when your data includes at least 2 rows and 2 columns and are
searching for similarity between your data, and the strengths of the
similarity. </span></p>

conclude, it is observed that two dimensions well explains the relationship
between sausages and the sensory feelings reported by tasters. The cosine
circle tells us that Chimex and Capistrano are very similar to each other as
far as the columns go, judging by their distance. Alpino and Bafar are also
close to eachother but we cannot rely on that due to the distance Alpino has
from the edge of the circle. Duby is the most different sausage in relation to
the other sausages. As far as taste, Duby gives the sense of Guilty,
Depresssed, and joy. Bafar gives the sense of Salivating, Energetic, Soothed,

correspondence analysis is a method for analyzing multiple qualitative
variables. If our dataset has quantitative variables, we must translate them to
qualitative variables. Much is like CA and PCA such as how we look at the
chi-squared heat map. The difference is since they are both nominal variables,
we must interpret columns that represent different levels of one variable. We
can do this by disjunctively coding our quantitative variables into 1’s and
0’s. One variable will now represent a set of columns. The variables are
combined into new components and the amount of each variable in the component

next thing we want to look at are the factor scores for our important

which levels of these contribute to which dimension. It seems like the negative
end of the first dimension is made up of “MajorCat.STEM”, “MajorCat.Hu/So”
(Humanities and Social Sciences), “MajorCat.Econ” and “ClinCourse.NoClin”. The
positive end of the first dimension: “MajorCat.Psyc”, “MajorCat.Edu”, and
“ClinCourse.Clin”, and “MajorCat.ApMed”. The second dimension is made up of
“MajorCat.Econ”, “MajorCat.ApMed” (applied health science), and
“ClinCourse.NoClin” in the negatives and “MajorCat.Educ”, “ClinCourse.Clin”,
“MajorCat.Psych”,  “MajorCat.Hu/So”, and “MajorCat.Stem” in the positives. This
tells us which level of majors makes up which dimension. We might be able to
use this to find out which level MHL score they make up. Its also obvious that
some variables were positive in one dimension but negative on the other. To see
which variable is best represented in which dimension we look towards the bar

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>The
visualization of this data tells us a lot about colleges and their groupings.
The highest predictor of being in the top 10 or 25% of students seems to be
associated with instructional expenditure per student, room and board costs,
and out-of-state tuition. These students also seem to be the ones who donate
the most as alumni. The greatest predictor of a PhD student seems to also be
related to most of these variables (Outstate, Room.Board, perc.alumni, Expend).
The same goes for those achieving a terminal degree, and those who have a high
graduation rate, although graduation rate seems to go down with a higher
personal spending rate. Lastly, there is a high negative correlation between
the student/faculty ratio and instructional expenditure, percent the alumni
donated, room and board costs, and out-of-state tuition. This suggests a
negative relationship when there are more students per faculty member. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>As for the
groupings of these colleges (public/private) there is a reliable difference.
The latent variable map shows that these variables are clearly separated
between private and public, both in means and confidence intervals. This
suggests that there truly is a difference between students when they attend a
private school compared to a public school. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>DiSTATIS is an analytical method for analyzing multiple
tables of data (3 or more). In this method, variables are whole data tables. We
must find the best linear combinations of these data tables in order to create
new tables from the old ones. In DiSTATIS, the latent variables are called
partial projections- partial because if we combine them all, we get the whole
latent variable. We have one latent variable per original data table. In order
to run DiSTATIS, we must derive the data through multiple factor analysis and
multidimensional scaling to gather our distance matrices. These distances
tables are then converted into pseudo-covariance tables using double centering.

<p class=MsoNormal>This RV factor map shows the difference between men and

are more on the positive end of this dimension. The confidence intervals tell
me that the mean of men and women do not differ and that we cannot reliably
have group assignment. The significance of the second dimension is only 5% so I
will only consider the first dimension to explain our data. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The compromised scree plot shows us the dimension for the

<p class=MsoNormal>The relationships between the rows (products) for beers
looks like how we would expect it to after looking at the scree plot. We see
big chunks of correlation in the diagonals which tells us that there was a
general agreement for sorting these beers. It tells us that all these
participants saw a positive correlation between the first 15 beers compared to
the first 15 beers, a negative correlation between the last 15 beers to the first
15 beers, a negative correlation between the first 15 beers and the last 15

<p class=MsoNormal>This compromise factor map shows us the sub groupings

Mexican beers that likely is due to style of beer such as lager, light, and
dark. These groupings are separated on both dimensions. The second dimension
only has 10% significance whereas the first has 34%, so the separation of these
groups on the first dimension carries more weight. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The partial factor score compromise map shows us the
difference between men and women’s ratings on these products. Since the lines
that are connected to the beers seem to all be the same length, we can assume
that for most of these beers- men and women rated them the same. Although there
are a couple beers in which the lines are different lengths such as Guiness
(the one closest to the middle of the graph), which shows a difference between
women and men’s ratings on this beer. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center'><b>Summary</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>We can make an inference that men and women generally do not
rate Mexican beers much differently from one another. From additional research
it seems like the beers separated on the factor score map differed in things
like lightness and bitterness. The beers on the negative side of the first
dimension seem to be clean, crisp beers (except for Guiness which is a dark
beer). The subgroup on the positive end of the second dimension seem to be
lighter/bright beers and the subgroup on the negative end of the second
dimension seem to be darker, more bitter beers. In general, judging by the
partial factor score map, men and women rated these beers the same except for a
couple exceptions such as Guiness and Heineken. The scree plots and heat maps
also tell us that there was a general agreement on the ratings of Mexican beers
from these participants, with a high drop off in eigenvalue variance and large
correlation chunks in the row heat map</p>
