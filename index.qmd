##### Master of Science in machine learning, artificial intelligence, and neuroscience from The University of Texas at Dallas (tbc: 05/2023)

As a data analyst and researcher with experience in both academia and industry, I have developed a strong skill set in data science and statistical analysis using R, Python, SQL, and Tableau. My master's degree is in neuroscience, data science, and artificial intelligence which has made me comfortable in the intersection between healthcare and data. I have worked on projects ranging from linear regression to neural network models and have conducted research on hearing defects associated with Autism. I am seeking a challenging role in a dynamic and innovative organization where I can apply my skills and experience to solve complex problems.Â
